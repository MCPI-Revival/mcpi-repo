# MCPI-Repo Seeds
This is a list of Minecraft Pi seeds. Seeds are designated for Minecraft Pi Edition and Pocket Edition alpha versions 0.6.1 and earlier. Register your mcpi seeds here; what makes them useful and/or unique, are they useful for creative or survival?

## World Creation from Seed

 - **Method 1**: Use an Android device to use MCPE 0.6.1, to ensure your world is compatible with Pi. Create a world with a fixed seed using PE's create world pop-up. If you don't have PE 0.6.1, download the apk from [here](https://archive.org/download/MinecraftPE0.1.0/Minecraft%20PE%200.6.1.apk), and install it on an Android device.
 - **Method 2**: Use a MCPI Server software, such as [MCPI-Reborn](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/minecraft-pi-reborn/blob/master/docs/DEDICATED_SERVER.md) to create a world from a specific seed and gamemode, you can specify this in the 'server.properties' file if you use MCPI-Reborn. Put the gamemode and seed into the server.properties before generating the world.

## Seed Retrieval from World

If you want to retrieve the seed from a pre-existing Pi/PE world, use a MCPE-compatible NBT level editing tool, such as [MCPIedit](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/MCPIedit).   When you have launched MCPIedit, select your world's  level.dat file, located in the corresponding world folder. If you are successful, you should be able to see the seed for your world in the MCPIedit window, next to the "seed" label.
